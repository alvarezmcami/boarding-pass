## About Me 🚀
I'm a Human Resources professional, and have been working in this field for over 10 years. However, I have always found the IT world very fascinating, so I took a lead of faith and started studying from scratch -first Data Analytics and now Frontend Development and, I plan to continue improving my project by studying UX/UI Design.

I believe that with passion and perseverance, I will be able to achieve my goals.
